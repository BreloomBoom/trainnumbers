Basic program to find the solutions to the train number game.

Syndey Trains generally have a 4 digit number for each carriage.
A common game is to use basic arithmetic and each digit to make 10.
eg. A solution to 5215 is 5+(2-1)*5

trainnumbers.py doesn't change the order of the digits

permedtn.py uses all permutations
